In August 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49154673) railway stations serving London's commuter belt remained a prime target for bike thieves.

Across Great Britain, theft of bicycles from station property rose from 4,500 in 2016-17 to 6,400 last year, a rise of around 42%.

Campaigners and victims said more investment was needed to reduce this "low-risk, high-reward crime".

The Department for Transport said it wanted to improve security and install more CCTV to keep bikes safe.

The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed crime data from British Transport Police and footfall figures from the Office of Rail Regulation and Transport for London.

It found:
- Some 16,725 bikes had been stolen from 1,245 railway and London Underground stations from 2016-2019. 
- Many of the stations with the most thefts were located in London and the South East
